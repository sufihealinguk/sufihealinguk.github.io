            <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
            <p>How much is our happiness and well-being determined by the
              quality of relationships in our lives!</p>
            <p>Think about it: whenever any relationship in our lives is
              characterised by separation, judgment, distrust, fear or anger,
              the impact on our hearts, our quality of life and even our health
              can be quite detrimental.</p>
            <p>Conversely, relationships characterized by honesty, love, trust
              and generosity of spirit can create within us extraordinary levels
              of well-being that we didn't even think possible.</p>
            <p>From the Sufi perspective, God created differences within us so
              that we can “know” each other: appreciate the differences and also
              go past those differences to discover our essential oneness and
              even divinity itself.</p>
            <p>The challenges of honoring differences and finding underlying
              unity create unique spiritual opportunities to develop a heart
              that truly carries divine peace, love and compassion in any
              circumstance. The Sufi tradition provides profound insights,
              spiritual practices and various effective healing modalities to
              arrive at spiritual wholeness and completion through love.</p>
            <p>We invite you to join us for the third weekend in this unique
              series of teachings. Don't worry if you've missed one or even both
              of the previous workshops, review materials will be made available
              to any new registrants.</p>

            <p>As they say, “No previous experience necessary!” </p>
            <p>Once you register, we will provide you with the opportunity to
              learn some of the material taught in the previous workshops. This
              will help to bring you up to speed and also give you a chance to
              put some of the principles into practice in your lives before
              joining us for the September workshop. </p>
            <p> Here is some of the feedback we received from the first
              workshop:</p>
            <p> <i>"I appreciated most the atmosphere of love and kindness that
                pervaded the whole weekend. I felt safe to explore."</i> - F.M.,
              Writer, Mediator, Foster Carer </p>
            <p> <i>"I really felt elated after I left the workshop and it
                really felt like home.”</i> - N.I., Dentist</p>
            <p> <i>"The teachers are excellent and hold a very safe, nurturing
                space for participants to drop deeply into themselves. They have
                a wealth of experience and are able to transmit rich and
                inspired teachings and give support. I will definitely attend
                any future events. I loved it."</i> - M.P., Retired Nurse</p>
            <p> <i>"I absolutely loved that we were such a diverse group."</i>
              - S.P., Antenatal Teacher and Doula</p>
            <p><em>"Nura and Wadude are incredibly sensitive and perceptive.
                They take you on a journey to understand yourself better and to
                make deeper connections with those around you. The teachings are
                very simple and yet at the same time deep and profound. They are
                also very human and funny. Where there is love there is laughter
                and where there is love there is self discovery."</em> - K.M.,
              Small Business Owner</p>
            <p><em>"What I appreciated most about Nura and Wadude’s teaching was
                the humility and lack of ego, the humour and humanity, and their
                honesty and sincerity." - anonymous</em></p>
            <p>Join us for this special opportunity to deepen or heal any of the
              relationships in your life in an atmosphere of safety, support,
              love and holiness. Our focus will be on personal healing and
              spiritual enrichment. Our time will be divided between didactic
              overview with class demonstrations, group healing processes,
              individual coaching (when requested), and private time for
              integration and reflection. Traditional Sufi practices that
              promote joy and celebration will be liberally sprinkled into the
              mix!</p>
            <p>There is no need to have any previous experience with Sufism.
              Also, you do not need to be in a primary, long-term relationship,
              or even want one. We all have “relationships” in our life that
              call for either healing or enrichment. Just come as you are, with
              what you care about. This is an open-ended, heart-based teaching.</p>
