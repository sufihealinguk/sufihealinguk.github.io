	    <h2>About the Workshop</h2>

	    <p>Our happiness and well-being can be tremendously
	    impacted by the quality of relationships in our lives.</p>

	    <p>Whenever our relationships include separation,
	    judgment, distrust, fear or anger, the impact on our
	    hearts, our quality of life and even our heath can be
	    detrimental.</p>

	    <p>Conversely, relationships characterized by honesty,
	    love, trust and generosity of spirit can create within us
	    extraordinary levels of well-being that we didn't even
	    think possible!</p>

	    <p>From the Sufi perspective, God created differences
	    within us so that we can “know” each other: appreciate the
	    differences and also go past those differences to discover
	    our essential oneness and even divinity itself.</p>

	    <p>The challenges of honoring differences and finding
	    underlying unity create unique spiritual opportunities to
	    develop a heart that truly carries divine peace, love and
	    compassion in any circumstance. The Sufi tradition
	    provides profound insights, spiritual practices and
	    various effective healing modalities to arrive at
	    spiritual wholeness and completion through love.</p>

	    <p>Join us for this special opportunity to deepen or heal
	    any of the relationships in your life in an atmosphere of
	    safety, support, love and holiness. Our focus will be on
	    personal healing and spiritual enrichment. Our time will
	    be divided between didactic overview with class
	    demonstrations, group healing processes, individual
	    coaching (when requested), and private time for
	    integration and reflection. Traditional Sufi practices
	    that promote joy and celebration will be liberally
	    sprinkled into the mix!</p>

	    <p>There is no need to have any previous experience with
	    Sufism. Also, you do not need to be in a primary,
	    long-term relationship, or even want one. We all have
	    “relationships” in our life that call for either healing
	    or enrichment. Just come as you are, with what you care
	    about. This is an open-ended, heart-based teaching.</p>

	    activities as a teacher and healer, Dr. Laird strives to
	    radiate the love of God to everyone he encounters. His
