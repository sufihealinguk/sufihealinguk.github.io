            <h2>About the Workshop</h2>

	    <p>How much is our happiness and well-being determined by
	      the quality of relationships in our lives!</p>

	    <p>Think about it: whenever any relationship in our lives is
	      characterised by separation, judgment, distrust, fear or
	      anger, the impact on our hearts, our quality of life and
	      even our health can be quite detrimental.</p>

	    <p>Conversely, relationships characterized by honesty, love,
	      trust and generosity of spirit can create within us
	      extraordinary levels of well-being that we didn&#39;t even think
	      possible.</p>

            <p>From the Sufi perspective, love is our natural
	      state. The key to living in that state lies in knowing your own heart
	      deeply: how to “guard” what enters your heart; how to free your heart
	      from burdens and distortions; how to receive “divine” love within the
	      inner realms of your heart.</p>
            <p>For this workshop we’ve chosen to focus on two practical areas of healing we’ve found to be
	      essential for establishing loving, peaceful and fulfilling relationships with anyone in your life:
	      <ul>
		<li>Transforming your “story”
		<li>Living in true forgiveness
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <h2>Transforming Your Story</h2>

	    
	    <p>Have you ever noticed the “story” you tell yourself repeatedly about who you are, and who you
	      aren’t? Our story emerges out of all the interpretations we make about ourselves and others in
	      a valiant effort to “understand” and create meaning out of all the disappointments and
	      difficulties we’ve faced. Over time, unfortunately, we decide our story carries the “truth” about
	      ourselves with devastating consequences to all our relationships and especially to our own
	      heart.</p>



	    <p>In this workshop, you’ll have a golden opportunity to wash away whatever in your story no
	      longer serves you and to step into a new “story” that emerges organically from your own spirit.
	      That story carries the love and beauty of who you truly are. Get ready to do this deep work in a
	      uniquely fun, supportive and profoundly effective way.</p>

	    <h2>Forgiveness Healing</h2>

	    <p>Have you ever noticed how difficult it can be to truly forgive others? Further, have you noticed
	      how burdened your heart becomes when you “hang on” to grudges, hurts and judgments? We
	      all do it. Unfortunately, our unwillingness or inability to forgive completely gradually eats away
	      at our hearts and erodes the fabric of love and compassion we feel for ourselves and others.
	      Forgiveness work can be most challenging but it is also the doorway to profound healing,
	      blessings and liberation. During our weekend together we will walk you through the specific
	      steps and skills that facilitate complete forgiveness and profound transformation in your heart
	      and spirit.</p>

	    <p>Throughout these teachings we will share with you the Sufi understandings of how to care for
	      your own heart and how to receive divine love, peace and healing directly into your heart.</p>

	    <h2>Our Invitation</h2>

	    <p>We invite you to join us and other like-minded and like-spirited participants for a weekend
	      dedicated to your own healing and transformation, offered in an atmosphere of care, love and
	      fun.</p>

	    <p>Our time will be divided between didactic overview with
	    class demonstrations, group healing processes, individual
	    coaching (when requested), and private time for
	    integration and reflection. Traditional Sufi practices
	    that promote joy and celebration will be liberally
	    sprinkled into the mix!</p>
	    
	    <p>There is no need to have any previous experience with
	    Sufism. We all have “relationships” in our life that call
	    for either healing or enrichment. Just come as you are,
	    with what you care about. This is an open-ended,
	    heart-based teaching.</p>

	    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

	                  <p> Here is some of the feedback we received from previous
		workshops:</p>
              <p><em> </em><i><em>"I have done a number of similar workshops and
                    courses in the past but these workshops far outweigh any
                    previous experiences with regards the quality of the teaching,
                    the depth of material, the amount of one-on-one time when
                    necessary with the coaches/support and the amount of love and
                    respect from not only the course leaders, but the participants
                    as well." </em></i><em></em>- Z.M., Musician<i><br>
              </i></p>
              <p><i>"I appreciated most the atmosphere of love and kindness that
                  pervaded the whole weekend. I felt safe to explore."</i> - F.M.,
		Writer, Mediator, Foster Carer </p>
              <p> <i>"I really felt elated after I left the workshop and it
                  really felt like home.”</i> - N.I., Dentist</p>
              <p> <i>"The teachers are excellent and hold a very safe, nurturing
                  space for participants to drop deeply into themselves. They have
                  a wealth of experience and are able to transmit rich and
                  inspired teachings and give support. I will definitely attend
                  any future events. I loved it."</i> - M.P., Retired Nurse</p>
              <p> <i>"I absolutely loved that we were such a diverse group."</i>
		- S.P., Antenatal Teacher and Doula</p>
              <p><em>"Nura and Wadude are incredibly sensitive and perceptive.
                  They take you on a journey to understand yourself better and to
                  make deeper connections with those around you. The teachings are
                  very simple and yet at the same time deep and profound. They are
                  also very human and funny. Where there is love there is laughter
                  and where there is love there is self discovery."</em> - K.M.,
		Small Business Owner</p>
              <p><em>"What I appreciated most about Nura and Wadude’s teaching was
                  the humility and lack of ego, the humour and humanity, and their
                  honesty and sincerity." - anonymous</em></p>
